any HLD for this but couple of major services which are used from GCP are:
Buckets: Buckets will be used for storage of incoming files in excel format. Buckets contain objects which can be accessed with ACL (Access Control List) properties. A bucket is always owned by the associated project's owner.
BigQuery: We will have multiple backend scripts /rule engines for checking and segregating data for utilization in visualization layer from buckets. Following are the checks that will run in BigQuery:
1.	Validation of data that has been added in buckets
2.	Incremental addition of data for specified frequency
3.	Modelling of data for flattening of data, transposing, creating relationships hierarchy and clubbing frequently queried data in parent-child relationships to use nested and repeated fields.
4.	Data is structured and stored a columnar format, with a schema and a data type in every column.
3.	Lastly, Have you considered any other alternatives for hosting this dashboard, such as Workbench?







### High-Level Design Overview

#### 1. Storage Layer:
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Buckets**:
  - Incoming files in Excel format will be stored in GCS buckets.
  - Buckets will contain objects with ACL properties for access control.
  - Ownership of buckets will be assigned to the associated project's owner.

#### 2. Data Processing and Analysis Layer:
- **Google BigQuery**:
  - Backend scripts and rule engines will run checks and segregate data for utilization in the visualization layer.
  - Validation of data added in buckets will be performed in BigQuery.
  - Incremental addition of data for specified frequency will be handled in BigQuery.
  - Data modeling tasks such as flattening, transposing, creating relationships hierarchy, and clubbing frequently queried data in parent-child relationships will be performed in BigQuery.
  - Data will be structured and stored in a columnar format, with a defined schema and data type for every column.

### Other Considerations:
- **Alternative Hosting Platforms**:
  - Consideration can be given to other platforms such as Google Data Studio or Looker for hosting the dashboard.
  - Google Data Studio provides a user-friendly interface for creating interactive dashboards directly from BigQuery data.
  - Looker offers powerful data modeling capabilities and visualization tools for creating and sharing insights from data.

### Summary:
- The high-level design utilizes Google Cloud Platform services such as Google Cloud Storage for storing incoming files and Google BigQuery for data processing and analysis tasks.
- The design emphasizes scalability, reliability, and ease of integration with other GCP services.
- Consideration can be given to alternative hosting platforms based on specific requirements and preferences for data visualization and dashboarding.

### Deep Architecture Design

#### 1. Storage Layer:
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Buckets**:
  - Multiple GCS buckets will be created to store incoming files in Excel format.
  - Each bucket will have appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs) configured to control access to the stored objects.
  - GCS provides high durability, scalability, and availability for storing large volumes of data.

#### 2. Data Processing and Analysis Layer:
- **Google BigQuery**:
  - Data from GCS buckets will be ingested into BigQuery for processing and analysis.
  - BigQuery provides a fully managed, scalable, and serverless data warehouse solution for analyzing large datasets.
  - BigQuery supports standard SQL for querying and processing data.
  - Schema-on-read approach allows flexible schema design and easy integration with different data formats.
  - Data validation, transformation, and modeling will be performed using BigQuery SQL queries and user-defined functions (UDFs).
  - Incremental data ingestion will be achieved using scheduled queries or streaming inserts.
  - Nested and repeated fields will be used to represent hierarchical data structures and parent-child relationships.
  - Views and materialized views can be created to optimize query performance for frequently accessed data.
  - Integration with Google Data Studio or Looker can be utilized for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

```

### Key Considerations:
- **Scalability and Performance**:
  - GCS and BigQuery are highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data and concurrent queries.
- **Data Security and Compliance**:
  - Access controls and encryption features provided by GCP ensure data security and compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Cost Optimization**:
  - Utilize cost-effective storage options in GCS and optimize query performance in BigQuery to minimize costs.
- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Set up monitoring and logging for GCS buckets and BigQuery queries to track data access, usage patterns, and performance metrics.
- **Data Governance and Compliance**:
  - Implement data governance policies and access controls to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and internal policies.

### Summary:
- The deep architecture design leverages GCP services such as GCS and BigQuery for storing and processing data from Excel files.
- GCS buckets provide scalable and durable storage for incoming files, while BigQuery offers a powerful data processing engine for analysis and modeling.
- The architecture is designed to be scalable, cost-effective, and compliant with data security and governance requirements.
